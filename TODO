Post-2010 TODOs:

- Fix the SEGDESC* macros to take a system/application flag argument

- lab1: do user-mode trap handling after memory initialization,
	or else don't panic in mem_init so kernel gets to user-mode test.
	Perhaps move user-mode test to lab2?

- Strip as much unnecessary garbage as possible out of printfmt.c

- get rid of tf_ and reg_ prefixes from trapframe and regs structs

- Rename 'dev' directory to 'hw', move kern/mp.* into it
	(since it's hardware-related but not really a device driver).

- Isn't it a bug (both in xv6 and PIOS) to EOI on a spurious interrupt?

- If your code panics in user(), then the problem is that printing
requires syscalls. Either implement enough of the syscall to get
printing to work, or do the following. Set IOPL flag to 3 and modify
cputs to NOT call sys_cputs. Basically what that means is the user
processes will print using the same method as the kernel, without going
through the interrupt.

- Don't include the 'refcount' member in 'pageinfo' until lab 3?

- Shouldn't proc_init() be called in init.c _before_ cpu_bootothers()?

- Add a field for the page fault linear address in trapframe?
