Post-2010 TODOs:

- Fix the SEGDESC* macros to take a system/application flag argument

- lab1: do user-mode trap handling after memory initialization,
	or else don't panic in mem_init so kernel gets to user-mode test.
	Perhaps move user-mode test to lab2?

- Strip as much unnecessary garbage as possible out of printfmt.c

- get rid of tf_ and reg_ prefixes from trapframe and regs structs

- Rename 'dev' directory to 'hw', move kern/mp.* into it
	(since it's hardware-related but not really a device driver).
