Post-2004 TODOs:

- get rid of redundant page_initpp() in kern/pmap.c

- get rid of size parameter to load_icode,
  which is no longer needed now that we're using ELF.

- get rid of -Ttext 0x800020 for user programs
  (and maybe UTEXT #define?)

- also, link kernel for 0xF0100000 instead of 0xF0100020
  (no need to reserve space for a non-existent a.out header)

- rename alloc() to boot_alloc() in kern/pmap.c
  to clarify that it's one of the boot-time init functions.

- get rid of unnecessary GATE macro in inc/mmu.h?

- in lab 3, do trap handling before starting user processes?
  (i.e., test fault handling in the kernel before user space)

- in lab 3, make students implement something in lib/syscall.c again -
  e.g., everything except sys_cputs().

After this year's class is over (fall 2003), we should:

- merge lab1, currently in the x86boot directory,
  properly into ossrc for consistency.

- rename PDMAP in inc/mmu.h to something more meaningful
  and consistent with the name of BY2PG...
  Maybe BY2PG => PGBYTES, and PDMAP => PDBYTES?

- clean up pp->ref_count protocol -
  e.g., have page_alloc increment the ref_count
  rather than leaving the caller to do it?

- Clean up #include blocks at the beginning of header files,
  so that conditional "#if LAB >= N" ones are at the end.

- Get rid of xstacktop parameter to sys_set_pgfault_handler

- Organize all the test programs in user/ a bit better,
  maybe in a separate test/ directory?

- Update lab4 so IPC can transfer page mappings

Also, (copied from Russ's E-mail):

	minishell in kernel - console i/o very early

	tie v6 to bsd/linux with special lecture at end of v6
		more mentions throughout

	tie x86 to v6 lectures more

	drop l3 in favor of good microkernel intro (amoeba?)

	replace ras with queued locks?  multiprocessor?

	use osdi soft updates

	io-lite?

	kill lab 1 to move everything up,
	more room at end

	challenge points accrued throughout semester

	more comments and less code

New TODO items for Fall 2004:

- change kernel link address from 0xf0100020 to 0xf0100000;
	we no longer need to reserve the 0x20 for the a.out header
	since we're now using ELF!
