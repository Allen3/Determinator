After this year's class is over (fall 2003), we should:

- merge lab1, currently in the x86boot directory,
  properly into ossrc for consistency.

- rename PDMAP in inc/mmu.h to something more meaningful
  and consistent with the name of BY2PG...
  Maybe BY2PG => PGBYTES, and PDMAP => PDBYTES?

- clean up pp->ref_count protocol -
  e.g., have page_alloc increment the ref_count
  rather than leaving the caller to do it?

- Clean up #include blocks at the beginning of header files,
  so that conditional "#if LAB >= N" ones are at the end.

- Get rid of xstacktop parameter to sys_set_pgfault_handler

- Organize all the test programs in user/ a bit better,
  maybe in a separate test/ directory?

- Update lab4 so IPC can transfer page mappings

Also, (copied from Russ's E-mail):

	minishell in kernel - console i/o very early

	tie v6 to bsd/linux with special lecture at end of v6
		more mentions throughout

	tie x86 to v6 lectures more

	drop l3 in favor of good microkernel intro (amoeba?)

	replace ras with queued locks?  multiprocessor?

	use osdi soft updates

	io-lite?

	kill lab 1 to move everything up,
	more room at end

	challenge points accrued throughout semester

	more comments and less code
