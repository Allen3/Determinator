Post-2010 TODOs:

- Fix the SEGDESC* macros to take a system/application flag argument

- lab1: do user-mode trap handling after memory initialization,
	or else don't panic in mem_init so kernel gets to user-mode test.
	Perhaps move user-mode test to lab2?

- Strip as much unnecessary garbage as possible out of printfmt.c
