After this year's class is over (fall 2003), we should:

- merge lab1, currently in the x86boot directory,
  properly into ossrc for consistency.

- rename PDMAP in inc/mmu.h to something more meaningful
  and consistent with the name of BY2PG...
  Maybe BY2PG => PGBYTES, and PDMAP => PDBYTES?

- clean up pp->ref_count protocol -
  e.g., have page_alloc increment the ref_count
  rather than leaving the caller to do it?

- Clean up #include blocks at the beginning of header files,
  so that conditional "#if LAB >= N" ones are at the end.

- Get rid of xstacktop parameter to sys_set_pgfault_handler

- Organize all the test programs in user/ a bit better,
  maybe in a separate test/ directory?

- Update lab4 so IPC can transfer page mappings
