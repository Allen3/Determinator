For instructions on building without doing exports, look at the top of
GNUMakefile.

Be warned against starting lines with dangerous things like
if/ifdef/ifndef/else/endif/fi unless they will be matched correctly by
mklab.pl.  this should only be a problem for strangely written perl
code or shell scripts.
