Since this is the "instructor's version" of PIOS, you first have to configure
it for a particular lab, which determines which parts of the source code are
included.  You probably want the lab4 version initially, since that's the most
complete non-distributed PIOS configuration:

	make LAB=4 SOL=4 labsetup

The lab5 version is the most complete (with the distributed computing
facilities), but the default testing rules in the makefiles automatically start
two virtual machines instead of just one, which can be a pain or just confusing
if you're not actually trying to test a distributed, cluster configuration of
PIOS.

For more instructions on building without doing exports, look at the top of
GNUMakefile.

Be warned against starting lines with dangerous things like
if/ifdef/ifndef/else/endif/fi unless they will be matched correctly by
mklab.pl.  this should only be a problem for strangely written perl
code or shell scripts.
